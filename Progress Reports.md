# Progress reports

## Week 5-6

### Progress

I’m slightly behind the plan in terms of documents written, I’ve completed a document with my requirements and my proposed solutions, and completed some research on the packet generator I would like to use, TRex.

### Meeting with Graham

I met with Graham on the 26th of August, and I caught him up on my plan for the project, and we discussed the challenges i’m anticipating going forward with the project.

### Challenges

TRex has a great depth of flexibility and configurability, and just understanding how it works on a core level is very difficult. I’ve been reading as much as I can find about it but the documentation isn’t very helpful to someone just getting started.

### Results

After the research I’ve done, I’m convinced that TRex will be a good solution, if I can overcome the challenge of understanding how it works and how to properly use it.

### Going Forward

I’m going to continue working with my mentors both at EIT and at my job at Inspire Net, and continue researching how to leverage these tools to achieve my goals.
