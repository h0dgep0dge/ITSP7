# Project Bitstream Requirements and Proposed Solution

## Requirements

### Functional

* The platform shall carry out network performance tests on routing and switching devices attached to its ports
* The platform shall be able to carry out a series of these tests automatically
* The platform shall be able to apply configuration changes on the device-under-test automatically between tests
* The platform shall generate reports showing changes in performance against changes in configuration

### Non-functional

* The platform may use a text based or command line based interface, but should be easy to use for a technical user, and give output that is easy to understand

## Proposed Solution

### Packet generation - TRex

TRex is an open source high performance packet generation software developed by Cisco. It is highly configurable and allows for very deep and nuanced testing. I think it would be very well suited to be the traffic generation and measurement component of this system, however the depth of configurability is going to be a challenge to master.

### Configuration deployment - Custom software

There are standardized protocols for deploying configuration to a networking device, such as TR-069. Although using a standardized protocol like this would give more flexibility in the devices that could be tested while varying configuration, I decided implementing TR-069 or trying to use an OTS TR-069 solution would be too complex for the scale of this project. Instead I plan to write a simple custom solution to target Mikrotik RouterOS devices, as most of the devices I have to test are Mikrotik routers.

### Test automation - Further research needed

Some tools for iteratively running TRex tests already exist, but itâ€™s not currently clear to me if these tools are generally applicable or only useful for narrow use-cases. This will require further investigation, and may require a custom solution.
